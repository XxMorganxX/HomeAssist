# Termination Audio File

The termination acknowledgment audio file `termination_ack.wav` should be placed in this directory.

This audio file will be played when the termination phrase is detected, to acknowledge that the system is returning to wake word detection mode.

## Suggested audio content:
- A short beep or chime
- A voice saying "Goodbye" or "Standing by"
- Any brief acknowledgment sound

## File requirements:
- Format: WAV, MP3, or MOV
- Duration: Preferably under 2 seconds
- Filename: termination_ack.wav (or .mp3, .mov)

## Note:
Until this file is added, the termination phrase will still work but without audio feedback.

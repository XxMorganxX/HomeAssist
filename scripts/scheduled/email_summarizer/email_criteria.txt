RELEVANCE CRITERIA (edit this file to change filtering)

An email is RELEVANT ONLY if it:
- REQUIRES immediate action or response from you (not just FYI)
- Contains URGENT deadlines within the next 7 days from TODAY (not past deadlines)
- Is about job interviews, offers, or application deadlines that haven't passed
- Contains bills that are DUE SOON (not paid confirmations)
- Is from professors about UPCOMING assignments, exams, or grade issues (not past ones)
- Contains meeting invitations for FUTURE dates that need RSVP
- Has personal messages from actual people requiring response (not automated)
- Any Graded Assignments or Assessments
- Has important information on upcoming or newly assigned class assignments or assessments

An email is NOT relevant if it is:
- Marketing, promotions, or sales of any kind
- Newsletters or digest emails
- Automated receipts or confirmations
- Social media notifications
- Security alerts or password resets (unless suspicious activity)
- General announcements without action required
- Event invitations you can ignore
- Course announcements that are just informational
- Automated system notifications
- Emails you're CC'd on but don't need to act on
- Old threads or follow-ups to completed items

STRICT GUIDELINES:
- Default to NOT RELEVANT unless clearly actionable
- Must have a FUTURE deadline or required action (past deadlines = NOT relevant)
- Generic updates and FYI emails are NOT relevant
- If you can safely ignore it without consequences, it's NOT relevant
- Only mark relevant if missing it would cause problems
- Use the CURRENT DATE to evaluate if deadlines have passed or are upcoming
